IMPLEMENT SELENIUM-WEBDRIVER TO RUN TESTS ON REAL WORLD WEB PAGES

1. Search for 'selenium-cucumber-js' on https://www.npmjs.com
2. Navigate to its GitHub link and click it then Fork the repository
3. Pick the link from repository in my account and clone it to local drive
    https://github.com/skcodeug/selenium-cucumber-js.git
4. Restore the packages as listed in the package.json using 'npm i'
5. Specifically, Chromedriver is outdated; reinstall/upgrade it using:
    npm install chromedriver --chromedriver_version=LATEST
6. Install the required selenium driver: 
    npm install selenium-cucumber-js --save-dev --force
7. Given that the package to download has the same name, add '--force'
8. In the 'index.js', increase the timeout value from '15000' to '60000'
9. The idea behind is too little time is allocated so it fails to get results
10. Run the test suite using: 'npm test' OR 'node index.js' as per 'package.json'
11. It will produce a Cucumber HTML report giving the results but opens in Safari!
12. On success, it shows all passed for the 3 scenarios & 8 steps
